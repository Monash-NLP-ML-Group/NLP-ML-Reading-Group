# Reading Group Presenter Guidelines

## First Presenter: Your Project Presentation
The presenter will provide an overview of their current work and research projects with the goal of increasing awareness and getting feedback from the team. Since some may not be familiar with the specific research area, the presenter should give sufficient background information to establish context and motivation for investigating this topic, including the key research questions they aim to address.

Depending on the stage of the work, the presenter may wish to cover:
- The proposed methods and preliminary results so far
- Future directions and experiments planned to move the work forward
- Specific questions or bottlenecks where the presenter would like input and feedback from the group in order to improve their research


## Second Presenter: Paper Presentation
For this presentation, the presenter will select a set of important papers or tutorial on a topic of their choice that would be interesting and beneficial for the group to learn about.

**Choosing papers:** Wthe presenter should select important publications that they find interesting and that would benefit the group to know about.

The presenter will only have 10-15 minutes per paper. For each one, they should briefly explain the key problem being addressed and the paper's main strengths and contributions. It is important to make connections to your own work and interests. Useful areas to cover are:
- A high-level overview of the methods and approach
- The main strengths, contributions and findings
- How is this paper relevant to your research?
- What can we learn from it?
